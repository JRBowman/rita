/* **** THREAT SCORE BUCKETS ****
Each Threat Indicator's score is placed into a categorical severity bucket.
Since the units of measurement for each threat indicator varies, we must
place the scores into buckets based on predefined thresholds for each bucket.

Each bucket has a set, non-configurable score that it applies to.
None:   0%
Low:    20%-40%
Medium: 41%-60%
High:   61%-80%
